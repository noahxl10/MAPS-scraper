the amount of deferred maintenance investment annually.

were responsible for independently reporting deferred maintenance needs and
annual spending toward addressing those needs.

maintenance 
strategy 1: change the conversation throughout higher education. educate policy 
makers about the impacts of the space profile, capital plans that are aligned with the 
institutional mission and risk, and improving operating effectiveness while lowering 
costs. 
strategy 2: set capital priorities to address the deferred maintenance needs in aging 
buildings that are determined to be critical to the mission and programmatic needs of 
universities. 
strategy 3: consider eliminating or replacing aging space with new modern facilities, 
especially buildings with certain construction vintages where poor quality construction 
was prevalent. sometimes less is more when it comes to addressing aging buildings 
with lots of deferred maintenance."

strategy 5: make annual stewardship (keep‐up) investment that addresses building 
components as they come due a priority at every campus. the more a campus keeps‐up 
with life cycles as they come due, the less deferred maintenance grows. 
strategy 6: institute facilities operational practices that are proactive at extending 
the life cycles of key expensive building components like hvac, electrical systems and 
roofs. proactive maintenance is not only a good idea when it comes to managing 
university facilities, it will save money in the long‐run."

""a common and legitimate question is why we cannot use reserve funds to address our budget shortfall,"" chancellor kumble subbaswamy said in a message to campus . ""first, because the university operates under a very tight budget each year, we do not have significant unallocated reserves."
