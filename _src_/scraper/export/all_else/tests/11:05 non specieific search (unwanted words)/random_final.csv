normal operating budget cycle due to a lack of funds.  lack of funding for routine maintenance can cause neglect, allowing minor repair work to evolve into more serious conditions. the problem is further compounded by choices made during austere financial times when routine maintenance is often deferred in order to meet other fiscal requirements."

                        educational understanding of food insecurity and provides a space for students to
                        volunteer with their peers.  nationally 20% of college students report having a “food insecurity” while in college
                        (national college and university food bank association). a fall 2016 student survey
                        conducted by southeast student government indicated that 15% of students reported
