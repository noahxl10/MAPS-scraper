deferred maintenance is the postponement of buildings and equipment upkeep from an entity's normal operating budget cycle due to a lack of funds."
1809,100663,Miami University-Hamilton,deferred maintenance,st_deferred_infrastructure_improvement,https://fs.illinois.edu/services/capital-programs/deferred-maintenance,200,No_meta_date,2020-11-05 12:16:37.773463,1,"s.  lack of funding for routine maintenance can cause neglect, allowing minor repair work to evolve into more serious conditions. the problem is further compounded by choices made during austere financial times when routine maintenance is often deferred in order to meet other fiscal requirements. the failure to take care of major repairs and/or restore building components that have reached the end of their useful lives results in a deferred maintenance backlog.    why is addressing deferred maintenance important?  properly maintained campus facilities reflect the pride of the institution. as a world class institution, the university of illinois must address basic facility needs in an energy efficient and fiscally responsible manner to continue to attract talented faculty and students."

strategy 2: set capital priorities to address the deferred maintenance needs in aging 
buildings that are determined to be critical to the mission and programmatic needs of 
universities.

especially buildings with certain construction vintages where poor quality construction 
was prevalent. sometimes less is more when it comes to addressing aging buildings 
with lots of deferred maintenance."

maintenance 
strategy 4: new construction must support the mission of the university and support 
the future program needs of each university. 
strategy 5: make annual stewardship (keep‐up) investment that addresses building 
components as they come due a priority at every campus. the more a campus keeps‐up 
with life cycles as they come due, the less deferred maintenance grows. 
strategy 6: institute facilities operational practices that are proactive at extending 
the life cycles of key expensive building components like hvac, electrical systems and 
roofs. proactive maintenance is not only a good idea when it comes to managing 
university facilities, it will save money in the long‐run."

      home in the area because of the cost of renovation combined with the 
      uncertainty of adjacent homes would become lodging houses (which in many 
      cases meant they would have their front yards graveled for parking, and 
      enter into a deferred maintenance mode). there was a cap on enrollment at the university, but it seemed every 
      time a house in our area went on the market it was purchased for student 
      rental (not surprising considering the income they produce). the city plan also listed the area's projected use as r-1,
