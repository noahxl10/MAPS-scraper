mississippi clarion ledger view comments  base salaries for the presidents of mississippi’s public research universities are once again equal, after a nearly two-year lag. minutes from a june board meeting show the state college board agreed to pay jackson state university president william bynum and university of southern mississippi president rodney bennett $300,000 annually in state funds. this brings them in line with the university of mississippi chancellor and mississippi state university president, whose salaries were raised in december 2015. while there is no written policy that the presidents of the state's research universities would be paid the same, it had been a long-standing policy.. prior to the salary hikes, ole miss chancellor jeff vitter was receiving $220,500, and msu president mark keenum, $227,500 in state funds. the new round of raises comes at a time when the state’s eight public universities have received approval to raise fall tuition amid state budget cuts. “we feel very comfortable with the salaries because historically the base salaries that we provide to the research university presidents are the same,” college board president c.d. smith said. jsu, ole miss, msu and usm are the state's sole public research universities. the state college board annually determines the pay scale for presidents in the eight-university system. and smith said it was “coincidental” that salary raises for the state’s research university presidents were approved separately and in pairs. “it’s not two here and two there,” he said. bennett donated his $72,630 raise to a usm scholarship fund, citing a sensitivity to the increase coming when the hattiesburg-based university had eliminated positions and held off on raising salaries for others. bynum, who served as the president of mississippi valley state university, before being named the 11th president of jsu, made $225,000 at valley. his current salary $375,000 is a boost of $150,000 from his previous post. the state college board requested that jsu's foundation contribute $75,000 of that amount. sandra hodge, with the university's division of institutional advancement, said the executive committee for the foundation has voted in favor of the supplement. that means bynum is making $154,500 more, an increase of 39 percent over the salary of his predecessor carolyn meyers. meyers was paid $270,500 at the height of her service at the country’s fourth largest historically black college and university. more than 80 percent of that amount, $220,500, came from state money. the supplement hike comes as the foundation has seen less in contributions. tax filings by the foundation show an uptick in contributions from $3.8 million in the 2014 fiscal year to $4.3 million in the 2015 fiscal year. a loss in net income for the 2015 fiscal year, however, resulted in a revenue of $4 million, a decrease from $5.9 million the year before. a filing for the 2016 fiscal year was not immediately available for review. hodge acknowledged that a decrease in revenue had led to ""shifts"" in order to allocate funds for university support. she provided no further details. asked whether the increased salary supplement was viewed as financially sound given a fluctuation in contributions to the foundation, which has also seen an increase in liabilities, hodge repeatedly emphasized that the foundation operates off of an annual budget that includes a salary supplement for jsu's president. private funds from university foundations, which make up a portion of presidents’ salaries, range from 4 percent on the low end such as at valley where $10,000 of interim president jerryl briggs $225,000 salary comes from private donations to 50 percent on the high end at ole miss and msu whose foundations match state appropriated funds at $300,000 each. during a july 14 news conference outlining his vision for the university, bynum told reporters, “we’re going to have a tough year or two in terms of really tightening our belt in the way we do in our own personal budgets and our personal household accounts. but at the end of the day, i’m confident that a year or two from now, we’ll be just fine.” bynum was referring to the ongoing efforts to regain the university’s financial footing following the depletion of 89 percent of jsu’s cash reserves during meyers’ tenure. thus far, that’s included implementing a budget reduction plan that involved layoffs of 42 employees, the elimination of 65 vacant positions, administrative restructuring and the merger of several academic departments. more: jsu slashes positions in budget recovery plan during his first week on the job, bynum also moved to reduce the salaries of several cabinet-level positions. smith said trustees were well-versed in the university’s financial status while considering the raise. he noted the university’s recovery would not be quick, but rather a multi-year endeavor with bynum at the helm. “(bynum’s) going to have to work really hard to position jackson state where we want it to be,” smith said. “we expect the work to justify the salary treatment.” contact bracey harris at 601-961-7248 or

""during that time, the university and its labor unions investigate steps that could be taken to address the emergency before any action is formally taken by the university, including the postponement of a scheduled 3 percent wage increase on july 1."" economic challenges rutgers has spent $50 million to refund students for unused campus services, such as dining, housing, and parking during remote instruction since mid-march. however, the university faces a class-action lawsuit for reimbursement of on-campus tuition and other expenses for services not utilized because of campus closings caused by the pandemic. earlier in the year, the university announced that it will lose $60 million in surgical procedures at rutgers medical centers canceled because of the pandemic, plus, because of a state spending freeze, $73 million in state appropriations through an extended fiscal year that ends on sept. 30. rutgers will get some of that back from the $68.8 million governor’s emergency education relief fund portion of the cares act, according to the state secretary of higher education, but the amount hasn't been determined yet. according to the u.s. department of education, rutgers also will receive another $27 million from the cares act to fill unanticipated costs caused by the pandemic. in the meantime, the university has been drawing on a $600 million reserve fund, devlin said. ""we will continue to draw down upon them because we will still have a deficit in (fiscal year 2021) even after taking extraordinary financial measures to fill the more than $260 million deficit projected for the balance of (fiscal year 2020) and for the next fiscal year which begins on july 1,"" she said. ""we have been negotiating in good faith and intend to continue to do so, especially during this critical 21-day period. we just reached an agreement on a furlough program with afscme that will save 450 jobs and are hopeful that more agreements can be reached."" earlier:  sen. diegnan pursues board of governors vote for rutgers student reps devlin said the university also has cuts by $7 million its athletics budget, which was $93 million in 2019, according to university documents. she said that includes a cut to the nearly $9 million the university's football coaches originally were contracted to receive, nearly half to returning coach greg schiano, who took a four-month 10 percent pay cut to his $4 million annual salary. each of his coaches took a four-month 5 percent cut. fiscal emergency earlier in the year, the university's senior leaders also took a 10 percent pay cut for four months and the next 100 top administrators took a 5 percent cut over the same period. but the coalition said it would like to see more of its cost- and job-saving suggestions met during the 21-day negotiation period and is hopeful incoming president jonathan holloway will make a positive administrative impact when he takes office on july 1. ""by declaring a financial emergency, rutgers is tearing up our contracts and unilaterally attacking our unions and our most vulnerable members,"" the coalition said in a statement. ""it is also turning its back on the plan developed by our coalition to confront the covid-19 crisis with a work-sharing furlough program that would prevent layoffs and program cuts, protect the most vulnerable, and bolster the university’s financial health. we ask president-designate holloway and the rutgers board of governors to exercise leadership and act now to steer a different course."" rutgers does not face a true fiscal emergency, according to the coalition. for the remainder of fiscal year 2020, the university is forecasting a negative change in fund balance operations of almost $58 million, devlin said. that figure doesn't warrant a fiscal emergency, said the coalition, which also stated that the university hasn't tapped enough into its $600 million reserve. ""generated in large part through hikes in undergraduate tuition over the past several years,"" the coalition said, ""these reserves are a literal 'rainy day' fund that could be used to balance the budget and provide support for graduate students and other vulnerable groups as we battle the overlapping public health and economic crises in new jersey."" in addition to state and federal relief funding, the university also will generate revenue from its covid-19 saliva test, which was produced by union members, the coalition said. the hiring of jackson lewis, which the coalition described as one of the country’s most notorious union-busting law firms, reveals that this battle is not primarily about money, union representatives said. ""instead, after squandering $10 million a week of potential savings from work-sharing, the administration is imposing a top-down vision of austerity on our state university that downplays its responsibilities to rutgers’ students and workforce,"" the coalition said. ""this is all the more troubling given the unwillingness of the rutgers leadership to take a significant salary cut during the crisis. while 312 high-level administrators make a total of $65.1 million in salary alone, they have only agreed to a 1 to 3.3 percent reduction in their total annual salaries because of the crisis."" in comparison, the coalition said, the administration at harvard university has taken a 20 percent pay cut for an entire year. the coalition said that it will organize to enforce contracts and pressure the administration to settle outstanding agreements and stop retaliating against medical faculty who speak out on behalf of union members. ""we will demand that rutgers preserve and enhance the pay of front-line health care workers facing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,"" the coalition said. ""we will insist that the administration rescind the order that effectively laid off 20 to 25 percent of our (part-time lecturers.) we will fight for a one-year funding extension for teaching assistants/graduate assistants, as well as for hardship funds for students who can’t receive federal relief and for all affected communities."" email: bmakin@gannettnj.com bob makin covers rutgers for mycentraljersey.com and the usa today network new jersey. to get unlimited access to his informative and entertaining work, please subscribe or activate your digital account today . about us  corrections  staff directory  careers  accessibility support  site map  legals  our ethical principles  terms of service  privacy policy  your california privacy rights / privacy policy  do not sell my info / cookie policy contact us  support local businesses  advertise your business  advertising terms and conditions  buy and sell  help center  subscriber guide  my account  give feedback subscribe today  newsletters  mobile apps  facebook  twitter  e-edition  storytellers  archives  rss feeds jobs  cars  homes  classifieds  education  moonlighting  reviewed  10best  reach local © 2020 www.mycentraljersey.com. all rights reserved."

savings  workforce needs  health research  sustainability culture        mississippi public universities stretch resources through efficiency efforts  3/4/2019 - jackson, miss.  leaders at mississippi public universities are focused on providing a quality education that is accessible and affordable for students. finding cost savings wherever possible is a key part of this effort.  delta state university has partnered with entergy to replace outdated light fixtures with energy-efficient led models for all exterior lights across campusâmore than 60 of them. this not only saves utility costsâof approximately 60 percentâbut also provides a more secure campus. delta state also replaced more than 600 light fixtures in its library with energy-efficient led alternatives, a switch that additionally made the environment more student-friendly.  recent building renovations also save delta state money. the refurbishment of its cafeteria included the latest energy-efficient kitchen equipment and an open design that utilizes more natural light. state-of-the-art renovations to its music building included all new energy-efficient lighting and heating and cooling equipment.  delta state is in the process of installing hvac controls for several academic buildings that currently have none. this will conserve energy tremendously.  all these efforts helped delta state decrease its utility cost approximately 28 percent in the past 12 months.  delta state continues to evaluate other academic buildings to make similar improvements.  mississippi state universityâs sustainability policy and the msu climate action plan set the course for msuâs efficiency efforts. these key documents lay out the parameters for success with respect to operating a more energy efficient campus as well as becoming a cleaner more environmentally friendly campus.  efforts to improve efficiency begin with investing in the right personnel but also includes initiatives such as regular monitoring and reporting of energy consumption, conversion from old-inefficient boiler/heater technologies to new high efficiency models, upgrades and expansions of the computer based control systems, optimizing equipment/building scheduling, retrofitting from fluorescent to led lighting technology, application of lighting control devices such as occupancy sensors, retro-commissioning of older building systems, and the addition of the msu ice plant.  in addition to the upgrades to infrastructure systems, msu has been aggressive in complying with the 30 percent better than ashrae 90.1 requirement of the msu/ihl sustainability policies on all major renovations and new construction. of course, the entire efficiency effort begins with a supportive administration and an engaged community. the sustainability committee has provided oversight and regular review of campus performance, and the administration provides the approval and funding necessary to move forward with important efficiency initiatives and projects.  mississippi university for women recently held a visioning exercise that included a cross section of about 50 campus representatives to have some broad discussions about the universityâs financial future and to understand that the economic framework of a college or university and its financial sustainability is the culmination of decisions made about its mission, structure, strengths and resources. participants explored questions related to the four dimensions of the economic framework, focusing on areas such as culture, policies and processes, decision making, leadership, governance, market factors, collaboration and innovation.  the atmos energy smartchoice program recently installed energy-efficient, low-flow devices across the campus of mississippi valley state university (mvsu). the goal is to help reduce the natural gas and water consumption of the university. new energy-saving showerheads and faucet aerators save thousands of gallons of water per year without sacrificing water pressure or performance. the equipment has a pressure compensating mechanism that provides a constant output of water pressure and helps to filter debris and build-up inside the showerhead or faucet.  mvsu and atmos energy are committed to working together to find other ways to reduce energy consumption throughout the campus. the atmos energy smartchoice program is dedicated to helping commercial and residential customers throughout the state to be more energy efficient and stop energy waste.  efficiency runs throughout the university of mississippiâs master plan, shaping decisions on building locations, utilities, roads, transportation, parking, cycling, and pedestrians. for example, the haley barbour center for manufacturing excellence is powered by the largest rooftop-mounted solar array in mississippi and insight park is equipped with solar shading and geothermal heating and cooling, as well as plug-ins for electrical vehicles.  at the university of southern mississippi, century park, the universityâs newest gated residential complex, was built with the goal of being a u.s. green building council silver leed (leadership in energy and environmental design)-certified building. the complex features 865 beds with a learning center that includes meeting spaces and study lounges.  these efforts have paid off in millions of dollars saved.  since 2006, mississippi state university has pursued aggressive goals in reducing its overall energy consumption per square foot and to date has seen over $52,000,000 in avoided utility costs due to running at a historically low energy usage index. msu is operating at over 40 percent more efficient in terms of btu/square foot than it was some 12 years ago.  mississippi valley state university expects to save $17,000 per year through the atmos energy smartchoice program.  ""we expect that the energy saving measures that were installed at mvsu by the atmos energy smartchoice program will save the university over 28,000 therms of natural gas per year, which is an estimated $17,000 annually,"" said terrance hurssey, mvsuâs director of facilities. ""also, we expect to save over 3,000,000 gallons of water per year by having this equipment installed. we are appreciative to atmos for their help in making our campus more efficient.""  in 2017, the university of mississippi offset three percent of the institution's electricity use from the previous fiscal year by purchasing 3,835 kilowatt hours of renewable energy certificates. the purchase is estimated to be the equivalent of growing 69,848 trees per year for 10 years or not using 6,240 barrels of oil.  the office of sustainability's compost program has diverted more than 91,000 pounds of pre-consumer campus food waste from the landfill since its establishment in 2013.  the university system has saved $106 million through energy efficiency efforts since 2006. the savings accrued by increasing energy efficiency on campus can be redirected to enhance classroom instruction, faculty research and academic support programs. each penny saved can be used to support this mission of providing an excellent education that is accessible and affordable for students.  # # #  the mississippi board of trustees of state institutions of higher learning governs the public universities in mississippi, including alcorn state university; delta state university; jackson state university; mississippi state university including the mississippi state university division of agriculture, forestry and veterinary medicine; mississippi university for women; mississippi valley state university; the university of mississippi including the university of mississippi medical center; and the university of southern mississippi.                           news archive     #advancingms  the pathway to growth for our state    â» economic development  â» energy savings  â» workforce needs  â» health research  â» sustainability culture  â» volunteer efforts  â» future educators  â» efficiency efforts  â» tourism        the universities  â» alcorn state university  â» delta state university  â» jackson state university  â» mississippi state university  â» mississippi university for women  â» mississippi valley state university  â» university of mississippi  â» university of southern mississippi  â» university mississippi medical center       quick links  â» board of trustees  â» commissioner of higher education  â» mississippi's public universities      student financial aid    rise up to a better life    one degree better    business engagement network    america reads - mississippi    jobs for mississippi graduates        board of trustees  commissioner of higher education  academic & student affairs  administration  business and economic development  communications  finance  governmental relations  office of internal audit  legal affairs, risk management & special projects  policy & strategic initiatives  real estate & facilties  strategic research  student financial aid  university research center (state economist)             © 2020 mississippi institutions of higher learning 3825 ridgewood road jackson, ms 39211 telephone: 601.432.6198  accountability and transparency     jobs for mississippi graduates  public records requests  legislative update: miss. code ann. §25-61-19  ethicspoint          "

34,63,https://olemiss.edu/faculty_senate/archives/association.html,200,"   [an error occurred while processing this directive]   university faculty senate association position statement  27 february 2001  the faculty senates association of mississippi [ufsa] is profoundly
concerned and troubled by the financial crisis facing mississippi's
tax supported public colleges and universities. the immediate
and potential long-term damage to our colleges and universities
is real and the future of higher education in mississippi is being
threatened.  the time has come for decisive political leadership from gov.
ronnie musgrove, lt. gov. amy tuck and the mississippi legislature
to preserve the investment in public higher education that has
already contributed much to mississippi's economic development.
public education, including higher education, is crucial for the
state's advancement in the twenty-first century and must receive
top priority for funding.  the citizens of mississippi must understand four key issues
facing their public colleges and universities.  point 1. the recent 5% budget cuts levied against public colleges
and universities, with the prospect of massive cuts in higher
education funding for the 2001-2002 academic year, will result
in immediate and long-lasting-perhaps even irreparable - damage
to mississippi higher education.  these budget cuts already have had an immediate impact and
will continue to imperil the quality of mississippi higher education
in the years ahead for the following reasons:  · loss of faculty to higher paying jobs outside of mississippi,
many of whom will not be replaced because of hiring freezes imposed
because of budget cuts;  · the ability to attract well-qualified faculty will
be compromised by inability to pay competitive salaries and a
track record of inconsistent pay raises;  · with less faculty, fewer classes will be offered and
class sizes will increase, reducing the effectiveness of instruction;  · the possible elimination of academic programs that
cannot be supported based on reduced state funding;  · regionally- and nationally-accredited academic programs
may be threatened;  · much needed investments in library resources and instructional
technologies will be jeopardized;  · already inadequate instructional operating budgets
will be further curtailed; and finally,  · further cuts to college and university budgets will
have a direct negative impact on local economies and dampen economic
development.    point 2. cutting college and university budgets will require
raising tuition, placing additional financial burdens on many
working students and their parents who seek brighter economic
futures through higher education.  · higher tuition and fees likely mean students will
find college and university education increasingly unaffordable
and their access to higher education will be diminished;  · diminished access to higher education can have an
economic impact, considering that the income gap between high
school and college graduates has widen over the past twenty years,
u.s. census figures show;  · students likely will become even more dependent upon
financial aid, especially student loans will increase the indebtedness
with which they begin their working lives; and,  · mississippi's existing shortage of public school teachers
could grow even more severe if students are saddled with additional
student loan debt.  point 3. mississippi's college and university faculty salaries
continue to lag behind national and regional standards, making
the recruitment and retention of qualified faculty even more difficult.  · college and university faculty salaries have not grown
at rates as high as those of all workers over the past 25 years,
the southern regional education board reports;  · average salaries for mississippi college and university
faculty rank no. 46 in the nation -- $ 9,200 behind the national
average, based on national education association figures;  · average salaries for mississippi college and university
faculty rank no. 12 among the 16 southern states - no change from
10 years ago and between $4,400 and $5,200 behind regional averages,
based on southern regional board figures;  · mississippi's college and university faculty received
no raises in six of the past 15 years, including three consecutive
years [1989 - 1992] of no raises. faculties received no raises
this year and are being told to brace for more of the same in
the next two to three years.  · the cost of living, including rising medical insurance
premiums, is increasing at the same time salaries are stagnant,
thus faculty experience an erosion in their purchasing power.  point 4. we call upon gov. ronnie musgrove, lt. gov. amy tuck
and the legislature to provide political leadership to avert the
immediate and the long-term financial crisis facing higher education
by:  · restoring mississippi's public four-year college and
university funding to the fy 2000 level before this recent round
of budget cuts;  · using the ""rainy day fund"" now to underwrite
that financial support of higher education;  · making the same commitment to college and university
faculty and staff that was made to public school teachers to raise
their salaries to the regional average; and, faculty,  · taking a leadership position to make hard political
choices to assure that all public education, including higher
education, is a top priority in mississippi and receives annual,
consistent, dependable and stable long-term financial support. ******************************* the university faculty senates association of mississippi [ufsa]

[ufsa] recognizes the following historic pattern regarding faculty
salaries:  1. the salaries of mississippi's public four-year colleges
and universities faculties have not grown at rates as high as
those of all workers, regardless of level of education, over the
past 25 years; 2. the faculties of mississippi's public four-year college and
universities have gone without pay raises in five of the past
15 years [ on average, one of every three years]; 3. faculty salaries have not grown at rates as high as those of
other workers with advanced levels of education over the last
10 years; 4. average salaries for mississippi's public four-year college
and university faculties ranked no. 12 among the 16 sreb states
in 1989 - 99, reflecting the same rank of a decade earlier; 5. mississippi's public college and university faculties received
no salary increase for the 2000 - 2001 academic year; 6. the cost of living, including rising medical insurance premiums,
is increasing at the same time salaries are stagnant, thus, faculty
experience an erosion in their salaries; 7. the mississippi legislature in the year 2000 committed itself
to raising the salaries of public school teachers based on projected

jackson state asks alumni to give to offset cash crunch  february 7, 2017 |  :     by jeff amy, associated press print jackson, miss. — jackson state university’s temporary leader monday asked alumni to dig into their pockets to overcome the school’s financial challenges.  interim president rod paige stated in a letter to graduates that the 10,000-student university’s expenses are exceeding income. he asked graduates to each contribute $100 to an “urgent fundraising campaign” that seeks to raise $5 million.  “this is a special personal request asking you to go beyond what you are already doing and respond to this current situation,” paige wrote, asking alumni to give in addition to any amount they might already donate.  a former u.s. secretary of education and a jsu graduate, paige said he’d lead by example and contribute $10,000 himself. he said jsu is also asking foundations and vendors to give.  giving levels to historically black colleges such as jsu are often lower than to other institutions. tax filings show jsu’s foundation has collected about $3.7 million annually in recent years. the university of southern mississippi, about half again as large as jsu, typically collects almost three times as much. jsu’s foundation had only $25 million in assets in mid-2015, while usm had $112 million.  the state gave $55 million to endow jsu and two other historically black universities as part of a desegregation settlement. it has pledged to raise additional private money for endowments, but has raised only $1 million.  president carolyn meyers resigned under college board pressure last year, after trustees intervened in university finances, saying she’d spent down jsu’s cash reserves to a dangerously low level. jsu had promised trustees that it would increase reserves, but paige said officials are having trouble reaching that goal because of overspending.  “now, as the university accounts payable exceed the accounts receivable, cash reserves are not available to fill the gap,” paige wrote. “this creates a dire situation, and immediate action must be taken.”  he said midyear state budget cuts are making financial recovery harder for jsu, taking $1.3 million so far this year.  paige wrote that jsu is trying to cut spending without harming academic programs through methods that include a hiring freeze and controls on travel spending. spokesman danny blanton said the fundraising campaign is part of an effort to raise revenue, attacking the cash crunch from both sides.  the interim leader is trying to firm up the university’s finances as the search for a permanent president moves forward. the college board said tuesday that its search committee would hold listening sessions with campus groups feb. 15 to discuss the qualities of a new president. last month, the board hired search firm witt/kieffer of oak brook, illinois, to help find a new president.        html                                 find jobs    post jobs

""our students have access to healthy foods; however, the surrounding community may not. and, there is food insecurity on our campus and most people don't even realize this. so, this effort with kroger really helps us out a lot.""  vice president and director of athletics ashley robinson is grateful for the partnership with kroger.  ""we thank kroger for investing in us. whenever i talk to anyone about sponsorships i include the whole university, not just athletics. so, this is a big deal for the refueling station and the tiger food pantry,"" robinson said.

jackson state university’s department of speech communication and theater — one of several departments being merged with others as a cost-saving measure — are angry about the decision and apprehensive about the outcome.  the board of trustees of state institutions of higher learning will vote thursday whether to approve this move and other recommendations that are a budget reduction and recovery plan for jackson state proposed by interim president dr. rod paige and his administration. the plan addresses the current financial crisis at jsu.  dr. mark g. henderson, chair of the department of speech communication and theater at jackson state university  “as chair of the department of speech communication and theater, and even more importantly as a graduate of the department, i was devastated,” said dr. mark g. henderson.  under the plan, henderson will return solely to professor status. henderson is one of the seven department chairs similarly affected.  “what you’re seeing is

 <p>students, faculty and alumni of jackson state university's department of speech communication and theater — one of several departments being merged with others as a cost-saving measure — are angry about the decision and apprehensive about the outcome.</p>
<p>the board of trustees of state institutions of higher learning will vote thursday whether to approve this move and other recommendations that are a budget reduction and recovery plan for jackson state proposed by interim president dr. rod paige and his administration. the plan addresses the current financial crisis at jsu.</p>
<p>""as chair of the department of speech communication and theater, and even more importantly as a graduate of the department, i was devastated,"" said dr. mark g. henderson.</p>
<p>under the plan, henderson will return solely to professor status. <span style=""font-size: 19.552px"">henderson is one of the seven department chairs similarly affected.  </span></p>

(with) einsteins bros. bagels in waterfield library, there are dollars there to improve that particular area.”  jackson said the curris center would be the focus of other renovations and major enhancements. one mentioned was a redesign and rebuild of the center’s parking lot that will offer roughly 30 additional spaces and improve lighting for students and staff.  “in regard to the curris center, there will be a major refresh and enhancement over the course of the next many months,” jackson said. “that is a focal point from student recruiting; it is a focal point for our students and it is a focal point for murray state university. so when we bring students here, the no. 1 determinate of turning a recruit into an enrollment is getting them on campus.  “we always must do a better job regarding getting more folks on campus. when they come to the campus, where do they go? they go to the curris center. so there are some things we need to do to the curris center to enhance that experience for prospective students and families.”   jackson said that repairs to the j.h. richmond residential hall was slated to be completed by august. repairs to waterfield library involving water leaks and hvac systems repair were mentioned as well, in addition to renovations being made to the blackburn science building to accommodate new programs to that facility.  jackson said there would be renovations made to the entrance to sparks hall, included ada access improvements and the replacement of canopies. the parking lot of roy stewart stadium is also slated to be resurfaced.  jackson said woods hall would be razed very soon, and that the new fine arts building, as one of the largest and most visible structures on campus, would be subjected to pressure washing and a possible new paint job.  “we are looking at energy savings performance contracts; we have talked to the board a little bit about these particular items,” jackson said. “we need to replace lighting, we need to replace hvac systems, we need to update the 1940s version of things to 2019. so we are talking to firms in regard to that type of work. our no. 1 deferred maintenance project on this campus, our biggest capital project, is about a $16 million project and that is our electrical grid.” jackson noted that the old richmond residential college would not be used in the fall, and said that building could also be razed should the board of regents decide to do so.  “we have a firm right now looking at housing facilities,” jackson said. “old richmond will not be used in the fall, and a recommendation may go to the board to take that building down as well. empty buildings are huge liability and safety issues.”          facebook        twitter        whatsapp        sms        email        print        save                  tags   bob jackson    building industry    curris center    facility    campus    renovation    university    building        recommended for you                        newsletters      success! an email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.     error! there was an error processing your request.         news updates  would you like to receive our weekly news? signup today!         please enter a valid email address.     sign up    manage your lists               most popular      articles    images    videos    commented      articles obituaries oct. 9, 2020 murray residents charged in mayfield shooting obituaries oct. 8, 2020 surprise from sims; murray native makes virtual appearance for north students, announces donated materials from education company obituaries oct. 12, 2020 obituaries oct. 13, 2020 ccso: discovery of body thursday morning doesn’t involve foul play ccso: paducah man flown to  hospital following collision murray council passes tax hike obituaries oct. 10, 2020   images                                                                          videos           commented sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.       submit your news    we're always interested in hearing about news in our community. let us know what's going on!  contact us      latest e-edition                     e-edition     to view our latest e-edition, click the image on the left.             special section                     everyday heroes 2020     to view our latest special section, click the image on the left.                                           sections      home    news    sports    opinion    business directory    datebook    obituaries    photos    videos    e-edition    weather    murrayledger.com 1001 whitnell ave. murray, ky 42071 u.s.a.  phone: 270-753-1916  email:  circulation@murrayledger.com     services     contact us    submission forms    refund policy    place an ad         facebook       twitter              © copyright 2020 murray ledger & times , 1001 whitnell ave. murray, ky | terms of use | privacy policy  powered by blox content management system from townnews.com .

05/27/2020 - 04:59 pm                on may 21, the university of mississippi medical center announced that it would have to lay off employees and reduce salaries for employees making more than $100,000 a year, as a result of losses related to the covid-19 outbreak. in a statement provided by the hospital, vice chancellor louann woodward annouced that some layoffs would occur, hiring freezes would be implemented, and salary reductions would be put in place for some administrative employees. the letter, which was sent to all ummc staff, faculty and students on may 21, stated that the hospital had lost about a million dollars a day in revenue as a result of the covid outbreak. during the outbreak, most non-essential surgeries were banned, cutting into the hospital's revenues. below is a copy of the letter: members of the ummc community,  i am writing today to share with you the next phase of our ongoing response to the covid-19 pandemic. specifically, i want to address the unprecedented financial challenges we face and, with firm commitment to keeping you well-informed, to describe our path forward and the actions that will be necessary to protect our institution and to preserve its important missions.               i have previously described  how you, the people of ummc, have responded to the challenges of covid-19 in many amazing ways.  simply stated, you have stepped up to serve our patients, the ummc community and mississippi in nothing less than heroic fashion.  for that, i am grateful and have never been more proud. i know you will continue to rise to the challenge, however large and whatever it may be.  the path forward  on multiple occasions i have emphasized that our top priority is the health and safety of our patients, faculty, staff and students.  in all settings – clinical care, research, education and the service areas – this is foremost in our thinking and influences decisions made on all fronts, including the ramp up of clinical activities and research, the use of ppe, the timing of students and employees returning to campus, and the ongoing patient visitor policy, just to name a few.  as the state and nation move to re-open, we will continue to monitor all aspects of the situation around us and be prepared to respond in a flexible, measured and thoughtful manner that is informed by reliable data and the best available expertise.  we all recognize that there is substantial uncertainty in what the foreseeable future holds.  while on the immediate horizon we see a devastating budget shortfall, we must not lose sight of long-term strategic priorities that are critical to the future success of all three mission areas that make up ummc.               it is my goal to be broadly transparent as we take actions to address the financial shortfall and ensure the future of this great medical center.  in my opinion, those of us in leadership have been given a responsibility to guard that future.  this responsibility weighs heavily on my mind and on my heart.  financial impact  even as amazing work and the hard fight against covid-19 continues, we are witnessing widespread financial upheaval and uncertainty across our external environment.  on a daily basis we learn of new budget cuts, closures, layoffs and furloughs occurring at hospitals, physician groups, universities and academic medical centers nationwide.  volatility in the stock market, rising unemployment and reduced state revenues create additional anxiety.  we have not been immune to these external economic effects. despite some areas within our organization being busier than ever in response to covid-19, patient volumes dropped significantly and revenues decreased correspondingly.  we have experienced a patient care revenue loss of more than $1 million per day since mid-march, and this loss continues day after day.  health-related enterprises across the country are reporting similar huge financial challenges.  and as unemployment increases, so will the number of patients who do not have adequate health insurance coverage.  with a decline in state revenues and with increases in other financial pressures, we anticipate state appropriations will be even more constrained than usual.                 our internal projections show a negative $100 million financial impact to ummc’s bottom line through september 2020.  this projection assumes that patient volumes in clinics, inpatient beds and ors return to 85 percent of our baseline by the end of june 2020.  this forecast is inclusive of lost revenue and covid-19 expenses, while also accounting for the anticipated receipt of federal relief funding.  but expectations for abundant federal funding or relief funding from other sources are guarded at this point.  in april, health care entities across mississippi collectively received $375 million in federal funds, of which ummc received only $17 million.  those funds were allocated based on a metric that was easy for the federal government to ascertain and apply – prior year medicare receipts by entity – but had nothing to do with covid-19 preparation or activity.  to date, about $700 million in federal relief funds have been disbursed to mississippi health care entities, and thus far, ummc has received $25 million across the entire health system (less than 4 percent of funding provided to mississippi health care entities).  while expectations must be guarded, we will continue to aggressively pursue any and all federal funding opportunities for which we qualify.  and we will energetically pursue all avenues to maximize revenues.  however, it has become an absolute certainty that these efforts alone will not offset the serious budget deficit we are now facing.  we closed the month of february with a year-to-date $20 million positive margin.  at that point, we were on track to achieve our full 12-month operating and cash budgets by the end of our fiscal year.  despite the covid-19-related financial downturn since mid-march, our balance sheet remains strong and we have the assets required for us to survive this period of financial crisis.  but each day we operate at reduced revenue levels drains additional cash from our balance sheet and weakens our ability to accomplish future goals and achieve our mission.                 facing this large financial deficit will require long, hard work and will test all of us.  i would dare say ummc has not faced a challenge of this magnitude in all of its 65 years of existence.  it will take guts, grit and fortitude to pull through to the other side.  very tough decisions with difficult consequences will be required.  however, i am confident we can and we will weather this storm and emerge stronger than ever.   actions required  it is in this spirit, and with the clear intent of minimizing negative impact on the front line of patient care, that i share with you some of the actions required to address this challenge we face.  some of these actions are now in effect, others are soon to be implemented and some will take effect once operational details have been finalized.                  salary reductions for executive leadership : executive leaders, including myself, the chancellor, members of the executive cabinet, deans, school of medicine department chairs and health system executives have reduced our salaries by 15 percent for three months starting may 1.  restriction on new hires : along with the cfo, chief human resources officer, and vc chief of staff, i am personally reviewing all hiring requests.  staff – all hiring proposals will go through several levels of approval with only rare approvals occurring for any hire that is not deemed necessary for direct patient care.  faculty – with rare exceptions, recruitment of new faculty is paused.                  restriction on travel: for the remainder of fy20 and for fy21, ummc-sponsored travel will be approved only for rare circumstances.  capital budget reduction: we will reduce the capital budget and  delay capital spending to the degree possible.  non-personnel reductions : we will vigorously review contracts for services, leases, working arrangements with vendors and other services for discounts and savings opportunities.   salary reductions: salaries for faculty and staff earning more than $100k per year  will be reduced by 10 percent  for three months starting july 1, 2020.                indirects and released funds: until further notice, indirects from grants and released funds will not be returned to departments.  faculty and staff separations: although we are implementing the initiatives above, regrettably some separations and layoffs are required.  decisions are being made at the departmental, school, program and unit level with sensitivity to avoiding compromise of our core missions.   closing thoughts  as i said earlier – this is terribly hard for all of us.  no one will be untouched by the impact of this pandemic.  we will do the hard work to ensure the future of this medical center.  we will not disappoint those who came before us and we will, to the best of our ability, position those who follow us for success.                we will, as we have before, proceed with courage.  we will be persistent.  and we will perservere.  i know i can count on you to step up to the challenge.  an abbreviated portion of a quote i shared recently in the vc notes is, “all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”  as for me, for the time given to me, i will lead this medical center with determination, hard work, honesty, integrity and as much courage as i can muster.  i am willing to make the difficult decisions today for the hope of what will be tomorrow.  the mission of ummc and our vision for a healthier mississippi has never been more critical than at this moment in time.  #ummcstrong             ‹ previous next ›
