""we were pretty certain that salary reductions wouldn’t preclude a furlough, but maybe a furlough would prevent some salary reductions,"" she said in an interview.  drew had already experienced financial struggles in recent years. but it is not alone in feeling increased pressure that forces furloughs amid the coronavirus.  the university of new haven -- which is expecting a $12 million to $15 million in revenue loss due to issuing student refunds and credits -- announced across-the-board pay reductions for faculty and staff two weeks ago. last week, the university announced that some employees would be furloughed .  furloughs are sometimes used as defensive measures, rodgers said. they can better position colleges should their financial situations get worse, “i.e., this fall, if it turns out that students, for whatever reason, don't come back.”  guilford college in north carolina has furloughed 133 people, more than half of its nonfaculty employees.  “many of the jobs that we were looking at were really the jobs that couldn’t be done from home, because they involved direct contact with students,” said jane fernandes, president of guilford. “we decided that just to help -- not to solve anything -- but to help our budget get to the end of the year, we would furlough staff.”  marquette university announced wednesday it would furlough approximately 250 employees beginning in mid-april. bob jones university, a private evangelical university in greenville, s.c., also announced wednesday that about 50 employees would be furloughed, with the potential for more down the road.  the furloughs don't appear to be cutting into faculty ranks at this time, although faculty numbers are likely to be affected by already announced hiring freezes , reductions in pay and other actions at colleges and universities around the country.  the first round of furloughs and layoffs is typically operationally easier on colleges, rodgers said.  “those initial layoffs and furloughs typically are -- you have to be careful when you say this -- not too difficult for the university to administer,” rodgers said. “if you get into the situation where a lot of students choose not to come back to campus and you have to implement a more broad-based reduction, that would be more challenging for any university to implement … because then you have to cut into core programming.”  employees who work on campuses for third-party vendors that contract with colleges are also being laid off. bon appétit management company, which provides dining services to many colleges around the country, has furloughed many of its employees . contract workers are not usually considered employees of the college they work at, and they face an uncertain future until students return to campus.  colleges are borrowing money to bolster their cash positions, but not to support recurring operations, including payroll, rodgers said.  “we view unfavorably any organization that borrows money to support recurring operations, including for payroll purposes,” he continued.  june is likely to be a key decision point on future furloughs and layoffs, rodgers said, because the june 30 end of the fiscal year will be approaching. colleges will be working out their budgets for the new 2021 fiscal year.  “they’re trying to see how this is going to impact their fiscal '21 budget,” he said. “they’re having to make assumptions that may be very difficult to make as far as what enrollment to anticipate under scenario one, scenario two, scenario three.”      read more by   emma whitford     coronavirus      live updates: latest news on coronavirus and higher education - 41 min ago            worrying enrollment trends continue, clearinghouse report shows - oct 15 4 hours 9 min ago    students continue to be stressed about college, their futures - oct 15 20 min 15 sec ago    ithaca announces sweeping faculty cuts - oct 15 4 hours 5 min ago    as college staff face layoffs, some argue against budget cuts - oct 14 october 14, 2020      1 of 154  ›    see all content »             be the first to know. get our free daily newsletter.                 search over 22,000 jobs  search   browse all jobs on inside higher ed careers »  hiring?

colleges and universities is more than 10 percent below their peers in other states. additional funding for faculty salary increases is critical to our public institutionsâ efforts to competitively retain and recruit quality faculty. low salary levels are straining faculty retention and recruiting in nursing, business, education, sciences, engineering and other high demand programs that are essential to meet oklahomaâs workforce needs.  task force on the future of higher education  the  state regents’ task force on the future of higher education conducted a  comprehensive assessment of

after 10 months of study and deliberations, the task force unanimously issued a  set of comprehensive cost saving, innovative strategies to increase degree  completion in our state.  students who learn here earn here  a  student with a college degree will earn $1.1 million more in a lifetime than a  high school graduate. more than 87 percent of oklahoma residents who graduate with a  bachelor’s degree remain in the state and are employed in the state one year  after graduation.  source: 2018 employment outcomes report.  oklahoma's promise  the  state system of higher education strongly supports protecting the dedicated  funding source for the oklahoma’s promise scholarship, which provides college  funding for approximately 18,000 students. over 80,000 oklahoma students have  met the eligibility requirements and earned the scholarship since the program’s  inception.  workforce and economic impact of public higher education  according to the georgetown center for education and the workforce, by 2020, 67 percent of jobs in oklahoma will require a college degree or additional postsecondary education and training, and 37 percent will require an associate degree, bachelorâs degree or higher. oklahoma higher education links academic programs directly to employment needs in the stateâs wealth-generating ecosystems, and degree and certificate production in critical stem disciplines has increased 47 percent over the last seven years.  our public higher education system supported $8.2 billion in total economic output in fy 2016. for every dollar of state appropriations invested, the state system of higher education generates $9.40 in economic output.  complete college america  oklahomaâs public and private institutions and career technology centers continue working to reach the stateâs goal of increasing the number of degrees and certificates earned through our complete college america initiative. despite successive years of budget cuts to public higher education, in the first five years of the cca initiative, the number of degrees and certificates earned in oklahoma increased by 8,912, surpassing the stateâs benchmark of 8,500.  additional degrees and certificates earned:  five-year goal: 8,500. five-year results: 8,912.  other states are investing in degree completion, while state support of oklahoma public higher education has been cut 26 percent since the start of the recession in 2008. data from the state higher education executive officers association show that oklahoma ranks last among the 33 participating cca states in the percentage change in state funding support since the initiativeâs inception in 2011.  maintain current law on weapons on campus  oklahoma higher education supports the second amendment and  gun ownership. under current law, campus presidents have the discretion to  grant exceptions to institutional policy when an exception is warranted. the  current law is working. in the past 11 legislative sessions, bills have  been introduced or discussed that would allow weapons on campus. each attempt  has been successfully defeated to date, and ensuring similar legislation does  not become law will continue to be a state system priority. nationally recognized affordability  u.s.  news and world report ranks oklahoma tuition and fees as 7th-lowest in the  nation and student debt

      jeopardized the reputation and honor of a respected profession. the 
      alleged fraudulent financial statements, collapsed 401k, shredded 
      documents, testimony traded for immunity, fifth amendment pleas, and 
      suicide have made this a soap opera on a grand scale. does this ring the

  central university, po box 19407, durham, nc 27707     the goal of this study was to make comparisons based on a measure of 
      collectivism among three sets of college students. it was hypothesized 
      that there would be differences among the students based on race and 
      gender; in addition, social class and religion were measured. this study 
      focused on white students at two majority-white schools and black students 
      at a majority-black school. significant gender, social class, and religion 
      differences were found. the lack of a significant difference for race was 
      surprising, given the results of past studies.     an investigation of the effect 
  of alternative international income reporting model on lending decisions  linda m. nichols  professor of accounting , college of business administration , texas tech university, lubbock, 
  tx 79409        income reporting continues to be an area of debate on a worldwide 
      basis. the fasb, along with the iasc and other standard-setting boards 
      have issued two special reports on the subject. the first report 
      identified four basic income reporting models while the second report 
      recommended the use of one of those models. this study examines the 
      usefulness of the four models by asking bank loan officers to make lending 
      decisions based on corporate financial statements using one of the four 
      models identified in the first special report. the results are consistent 
      with use of the model recommended in the second special report.     passing the buck:

  technology, texas a&m university - commerce, commerce, tx 75429      the concept of delegationï¿½traditionally viewed as ""downward""ï¿½is 
      extended by proposing an ""upward"" path whereby a manager defers a decision 
      within his or her realm of responsibility to a superior. a matrix is 
      developed that describes managerial styles based on propensities for 
      upward and downward delegation. empirical results suggest that the notion 
      of directional delegation is a useful tool for analyzing management 
      behavior. as suggested by jaques (1956) and jacques and cason (1994), 
      delegation styles may change over the course of a managerï¿½s career.     the cost of

  business administration, university of central oklahoma, edmond, ok 73034      tenure provides value to those who receive it. any attempt by a state 
      to eliminate it will significantly reduce occupational benefits. without 
      full compensation, current and future faculty members are likely to search 
      for and secure employment in states which still offer tenure, or even in 
      other occupations. this study uses a survey of current oklahoma college 
      faculty to estimate the monetary value of tenure, as well as to identify 
      those groups who value it more dearly. an econometric analysis provides a 
      means of predicting how the mix of faculty may be affected by any future 
      elimination of tenure.            web site courtesy:           report

 social justice theory subordinates all endeavors to the pursuit of political activism to enact social justice’s political goals. radical justice advocates have established themselves in higher education, and now seek to subordinate all aspects of higher education to the pursuit of social justice.  social justice advocates have succeeded alarmingly well at achieving their goals. i’ve written about this at greater length in my report, “social justice education in america,” published in 2019 by the national association of scholars. in this article i outline how social justice education works in higher education, with examples drawn from some of oklahoma’s public universities.  mission statements social justice advocates seek to alter university and department mission statements and institutional commitments because these act as promissory notes for future social justice initiatives. when the university of oklahoma says in its “statement of commitment to affirmative action” that it desires “to ensure social justice and promote campus diversity,” that’s not just a pious nostrum, but a hostage to fortune.  moreover, higher education accreditors want to see proof that a university lives up to its mission statement—so once the mission statement commits the university to social justice, it won’t get accredited unless it makes good on that promise.  graduation requirements social justice advocates then seek to alter general education requirements. they have inserted requirements that students take courses in areas such as diversity, experiential learning, and social justice, and also erected a system of multiple requirements and double-counted courses that steer students to take social justice courses.  for example, oklahoma state university has a diversity requirement, which students fulfill by taking courses such as american studies 3473 (“race, gender, and ethnicity in american film”), political science 2313 (“social justice politics”), and women’s and gender studies 3553 (“lgbtq lives in the united states”). social justice advocates capture immense numbers of tenure lines and tuition by requiring students to take social justice courses.  capturing disciplines and creating pseudo-disciplines social justice advocates also have seized or created large numbers of disciplines explicitly dedicated to social justice activism. the heaviest penetration of social justice advocacy is in identity group studies; american studies; gender studies; sustainability; global, human rights, and peace studies; health policy; urban studies; law; political science; public policy; education; social work; criminology; psychology; sociology; civic engagement; leadership; and social justice.  the university of oklahoma’s department of women’s and gender studies now offers a minor in social justice, in which students “will learn to utilize multidisciplinary and feminist approaches that recognize the struggles for liberation and the importance of social movements, advocacy, and activism locally and globally.”  these disciplines select and form social justice advocates by a combination of mission statements, requirements, and electives. the two required courses for the university of oklahoma’s minor in social justice are “social justice and social change” and “social justice internship.”  a course called “social justice internship”? yes. “a social justice internship provides students with the opportunity to give back to the community and become directly involved in working with social justice issues.” social justice educators use experiential learning courses—where students receive credit for work outside the classroom, usually for a nonprofit organization—to provide vocational training in progressive activism. the university of central oklahoma’s volunteer and service learning center “collaborates with a full-range of departments and community organizations to plan and implement a year-long social justice series. this series aims to raise interest in and awareness of social justice issues that impact our region, state, nation, and world.”  capturing university administration social justice advocates have taken over much of university administration, particularly offices devoted to the “co-curriculum.” they have also taken over the education of higher education administrators, and their professional organizations, and redefined their professional goals as the advancement of social justice.  bureaucracies taken over by social justice advocates are often the office of student affairs; office of first-year experience; office of community engagement; office of social justice; office of sustainability; office of equity and inclusion; office of diversity and multicultural affairs; miscellaneous “institutes” and “centers”; and the title ix office. the university of oklahoma alone boasts social justice bureaucracies including an office of diversity, equity, and inclusion; student affairs (which houses the gender and equality center); and the center for social justice.  social justice advocates make sure there is no escape from social justice advocacy. social justice now affects where students live and sleep, by way of the office of residential life and “living learning communities.” oklahoma state university’s housing and residential life is committed to “promoting reflection of personal attitudes, integrity, and values while developing new ways of thinking about social justice” and “creating and supporting ongoing training and development of our staff in regards to social justice issues.”  social justice organizes voluntary informers to enforce social justice advocacy in all private life, by way of bias incident response teams. break and study abroad programs ensure that students remain yoked to social justice even in off-campus academic programs. the david l. boren college of international studies at the university of oklahoma offers interdisciplinary service learning: study abroad programs; students “learn social justice research methods” and “gain insights about social justice work,” while earning course credit for “women creating social change.”  individual events make up the fabric of campus life. a sample of social justice events gives a sense of the variety of means by which social justice education operates. the university of central oklahoma office of diversity and inclusion sponsors a hip hop social justice & well-being week. the university of oklahoma’s center for social justice sponsors teach out on race: “designed for a range of participants from budding allies to experienced activists, the teach out is an opportunity for attendees to intentionally consider what it means to practice anti-racism across the spaces where we teach, learn, and lead.”  suggested reforms higher education reform must disrupt higher education’s ability to provide stable careers for social justice advocates. the national association of scholars recommends the following general reforms:  1. eliminate experiential learning courses;  2. remove social justice education from undergraduate general education requirements;  3. remove social justice education from introductory college courses;  4. remove social justice requirements from departments that provide employment credentials;  5. remove social justice positions from higher education administration;  6. restrict the power of social justice advocates in higher education administration;  7. eliminate the “co-curriculum”; and  8. remove social justice requirements from higher education job advertisements.  these reforms should come at the federal level and at the state level. state legislators and boards of regents are best equipped to pursue these by their powers to oversee and, where necessary, defund public universities.  moreover, students should cease cooperating with social justice regulations. oppressive regimes collapse when their subjects no longer obey.     what is ‘social justice’?  “social justice” may mean particular things to particular people, says dr. peter w. wood, president of the national association of scholars. but in general it signifies only an emotional disposition, a sensibility, along the lines of the following:  i dislike the united states and american culture. american society treats people unfairly. american culture elevates the wealthy and the privileged over everybody else. it is oppressive. i’m oppressed. i want to change everything. i especially want to change things in the direction of redistributing wealth and privilege. those should be taken away from the people i don’t like and given to me and the people i do like. the key to making this happen is to raise awareness among those who are oppressed and who don’t necessarily know they are oppressed. calling for social justice is a way of bringing people together to overthrow the systemic injustices all around us.        david randall, ph.d.        view bio     share:                       oklahoma council of public affairs  1401 n. lincoln blvd. oklahoma city, ok 73104  p: 405.602.1667 • f: 855.819.0085   perspective magazine    [email protected]     ©2020 oklahoma council of public affairs  all rights reserved  site by nominee                "

         eric bailey  oklahoma’s athletic department will institute cost-cutting measures as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, the school announced wednesday night. the declaration comes in conjunction with the start of the 2020-21 fiscal year. athletic director joe castiglione said this is his department’s first steps in responding to covid-19 and there may be cause for additional measures in the future. “all of us understand that a number of circumstances will unfold in the weeks ahead,” castiglione said in a statement. “our staff continues to monitor our expense and income projections closely and we’ll take other actions as necessary.” ou will implement budget cuts of approximately $13.7 million in controllable operation expenses, including a 10% salary reduction for any employee earning a salary of $1 million or more per year.  football coach lincoln riley was paid $6 million last season, meaning he would have at least a $600,000 cut in pay.  ou’s football players began returning to campus this week in preparation for the start of voluntary workouts wednesday. on monday, 111 football players were administered tests for the coronavirus. seven tested positive. there were seven previous positive tests to bring the total cases among players to 14. the school said two of the players had recovered and 12 active cases remain. ou said 72 staff members were tested for covid-19 and there were two positive results.   the budget modifications include accountability for covid-19 expenses, which include testing protocols and increased safety measures. ou will maintain all financial aid services provided to student-athletes, including accommodations for extended eligibility.  castiglione said the department was able to balance the 2019-20 athletic budget. he remains optimistic about the upcoming school year. “our goal is to have all activities operate as safely and efficiently as possible,” he said. “that said, we are planning on a number of contingencies and protocols that will leave us prepared for any number of scenarios.”  +1              castiglione    chris landsberger/the oklahoman     eric bailey 918-581-8391

""it will hurt,"" mounce said.  ""we are in the process of downsizing.  as certain positions become vacant, they may not be filled, depending on how critical they are to the university's mission.           ""there are three administrative positions that have not been filled since about november (1992).  we are also in the process of evaluating programs to see if any should be eliminated and those resources re-allocated. ""   the state  regents for higher education began preparing for possible cuts after gov. david walters' proposal to cut state agency budgets by 9 percent.  in response to the proposal, higher education schools in oklahoma indicated a substantial number of classes might be cancelled and hundreds of full- and part-time professors could be laid off.  in february, higher regents chancellor hans brisch said the ""gloomy fiscal outlook makes faculty recruitment difficult, and student tuition hikes imperative. ""   offices of the state regents for higher education will be the site today  of a public hearing at 1 p.m. on the impact of possible budget cuts at oklahoma colleges and a 4 p.m. hearing on tuition and fees proposed for fall 1993.  regents have recommended tuition hikes for next school year, although the state legislature has the final say on the matter.              the offices are in the oliver hodge education building at the state capitol complex.  mounce this week explained that the university of central oklahoma would be able to weather the storm in the 1993-94 academic year because of earlier decisions.  ""we're in a little bit of a unique situation,"" she said.  ""before dr. (bill j.) lillard left office in december of 1991, he told me as chief fiscal officer, that he wanted to end the year with a 10 percent reserve, which was a fairly substantial amount.  ""when he left we had slightly more than a 10 percent reserve. ""   mounce said a large portion of that reserve was budgeted for a number of projects such as physical improvements, equipment, training and other needs.  she said the university also had one-time funding from the state legislature of $738,000.   (story continued below...)             she said that when george nigh became president of the university he made the decision to hold onto the one-time money and a large portion of the reserve funds that had been budgeted.  the physical improvements, equipment, training and other projects still represent unmet needs, she said.  ""he wanted us to hold onto it until we saw what would happen with the capital bond issue in the fall,"" mounce said.  if it had not passed, the university would have used the one-time money to build some badly needed classroom space.              but voters passed the issue, so the university intended to use the one-time money  for purposes already budgeted.  ""it did pass, but by the time it passed we had begun receiving information from the office of state finance that there might be a revenue shortfall by the end of the year,"" she said.  ""this also meant there might be cuts to higher education for academic year 1993-94.  ""therefore we made the decision to hold onto our one-time money and some of that reserve fund to offset the (possible) upcoming shortfall. ""   why did the former president of the university want the 10 percent reserve fund?  ""i think dr. lillard really wanted to have it available for george nigh to begin his new administration,"" she said.         as for fee increases, mounce said the state regents are proposing the following changes for regional universities: lower division courses would go from $37.75 per credit hour to $41.50, based on a 10 percent increase; the upper division, from $38.50 to $42.00, based on a 9 percent increase; and the graduate level, from $50.50 to $55.50, based on a 10 percent increase.  mounce said a 10 percent fee increase would provide the university of central oklahoma $1.5 million, which would still be about $1.1 million short in replacing the state appropriations that possibly could be lost.

(ap photo/sue ogrocki)    thursday, april 27, 2017 2:07 pm est  by sean murphy, ap    oklahoma city (ap) — four years ago, oklahoma's oil patch was booming, unemployment was falling and state lawmakers were debating what to do with $200 million in surplus revenue. republicans who control state government successfully pushed to reduce the state's top income tax rate, slash the oil and gas production tax rate from 7 percent to 2 percent and give more tax incentives to industry. but the boom ended and the money dried up. now the once-unwavering confidence in the wisdom of lower taxes has given way to a growing panic over how to pay for basic services such as schools, health care and public safety. revenue has fallen about 20 percent short of budgeted needs for the third year in a row. the situation has deteriorated to the point where highway patrol troopers have been warned not to fill their fuel tanks, and drunken drivers have been able to keep their licenses because there are not enough administrative workers to revoke their driving privileges. nearly 100 of the state's 513 school districts have moved to four-day weeks. oklahoma's woes are intensifying just as president donald trump's administration proposes its own ambitious plan to slash corporate and personal taxes. the white house insists the overhaul will spur economic growth and bring prosperity to the middle class, but the idea alarms lawmakers worried about the risk of ballooning federal deficits. state legislators have already tried cutting the budget. overall, last year's inflation-adjusted budget of $6.9 billion was 11 percent less than 2009, according to a recent analysis. but the spending cuts so far have not been enough to close a projected $900 million gap. lawmakers are weighing drastic steps such as reducing medicaid payments, which officials say could cause hundreds of nursing homes to close. ""we're not running the state based on a plan and a strategy. we're trying to operate it on a philosophy,"" said state auditor and inspector gary jones, a former oklahoma republican party chairman who's among a growing number of republicans and democrats calling for an about-face. ""it seems like we're afraid to admit we've made mistakes and correct them."" it's not clear that some in oklahoma's gop are ready to see taxes as a two-way street. the party holds more than three quarters of the legislature's seats. ""i think we need to ... make sure we've squeezed every nickel, dime and penny out of every corner that we can before we just start raising taxes,"" said republican mike schulz, the senate leader. oklahoma isn't the only red state in tax-cut distress. lawmakers in gop-led kansas, indiana, missouri and mississippi are debating ways of raising more revenue to ease budget problems. in neighboring arkansas, where republicans recently won control of the statehouse, gop leaders approved a more modest tax cut proposal than many conservatives wanted. it's difficult to pinpoint whether a specific tax cut leads to economic growth, but lowering the tax burden can sometimes spur the economy, said nicole kaeding, an economist for the tax foundation, a washington, d.c.-based research group. she cited north carolina as a state that cut individual and corporate tax rates while expanding the sales tax base. however, she said, tax revenue ""is just one side of the equation. if you just cut tax revenue but don't cut spending, the state of course is going to have a budget issue."" the situation in oklahoma is particularly dire because the state relies so heavily on the volatile oil and gas industry, which accounts for 13 percent of overall state earnings. also, term limits regularly send a fresh crop of newly elected gop officeholders to the capitol eager to redeem their campaign promises on lower taxes. schools, which receive half of state-appropriated funds, are feeling the brunt of the shortfall. the tulsa district is proposing to close four schools and scrap some sports programs. the state and regional science fairs were listed for elimination until a private donor came forward with a $50,000 check. teachers have not received a raise since 2008. many state agencies have had their budgets cut by 40 percent over the last three years. when many red states cut taxes in recent years after republicans made sweeping gains in the 2010 election, their leaders anticipated that any revenue loss would be temporary. ""there's been this persistent argument that if we cut taxes, the economy will grow enough to make up for the lost revenue, and it just simply doesn't happen,"" said economist mickey hepner, the dean of the university of central oklahoma's college of business. republican gov. mary fallin stands by oklahoma's 2014 individual income tax cut, which eliminated $135 million in annual revenue. she is now calling for tax hikes on cigarettes, fuel and a wide assortment of services to compensate. ""i've given a lot of different solutions for our legislature to consider,"" she said. but no revenue proposals have advanced yet. so far, fallin and other republicans have avoided paying a political price for the problems. many lawmakers count on support from conservative voters who believe that government can always be smaller. ""i think if we looked at any government agency, there's fat that can be trimmed, and that includes the schools,"" said zane grider, manager of a car dealership in newcastle whose two kids now attend school just four days a week. ""if we ran our business the way the government tries to run things, we'd all be broke."" democrats say they believe many are growing weary of the annual budget crisis. residents ""are waiting for leaders in this building to step up and lead,"" said house democratic leader rep. scott inman, a democratic candidate for governor in 2018. ""the republican majority, the governor and lieutenant governor, have failed to do so."" ___ follow sean murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy .    ap      you might also be interested in:    pandemic hammers small businesses vital to economic recovery    eu chief leaves summit to go into quarantine    candidate who embraces qanon endorses loeffler for senate    ap-norc poll: americans critical of trump handling of virus    over 5,600 afghan families displaced by fighting in south                                          on-air & up next         11:00am - 1:00pm   the hugh hewitt show      hugh hewitt is a broadcast pro who has informed and entertained on radio and television for over a decade.         1:00pm - 3:00pm   the dennis prager show            3:00pm - 6:00pm   america first with sebastian gorka            6:00pm - 9:00pm   the larry elder show            9:00pm - 11:00pm   the charlie kirk show        see the full program guide                                        "

 (by mandey7 (us geological survey) [public domain], via wikimedia commons )  support journalism state appropriations for higher education in oklahoma have dwindled in recent years. a recent study from illinois state university’s joint grapevine project shows oklahoma is now the lowest-ranked in state appropriations following a reduction of 17.8 percent in the past five years. although the university of oklahoma and oklahoma state university are better positioned to cushion themselves from reduced state funding, smaller schools find themselves taking drastic measures to deal with the latest budget realities.  following a year when the oklahoma state regents for higher education received a 16-percent cut in state appropriations, the state’s higher education system took on an additional 6 percent reduction for the current fiscal year. the fiscal year 2018 appropriation of $774 million was down from the $810 million allocated this past year and far less than the requested $958 million .  staff positions remain unfilled, stressed under budget cuts  the regional universities and two-year colleges have been scrambling during the past month to address the budget reductions. many of them are focused on leaving vacant staff positions unfilled as one way to keep costs down.  patti neuhold, vice president of finance, university of central oklahoma  patti neuhold, vice president of finance at the university of central oklahoma , said the ongoing state appropriation reductions cause a two-fold problem for the school: not only are some employees losing their jobs, but those who remain at the school are taking on additional workloads for at least a second-straight year.  “we’ve got people who have become conditioned to accepting more work,” neuhold said. “that’s unfair.”  at uco, cutting support-staff positions will be a focus. neuhold said there are adviser positions that are so thinned out that they just can’t be replaced. with one academic counselor per 1,500 students, neuhold said the school is already well below the national average .  uco isn’t the only school having to deal with the cuts. northeastern oklahoma state university is eliminating 26 filled and unfilled positions. northern oklahoma college decided to get rid of 42 part-time positions and 41 student-employment positions. at southwestern oklahoma state university , the decision was to leave some vacant positions unfilled, make additional cuts to the travel budget and reduce equipment purchases.  smaller schools fear tuition gap closing  while all the state’s public universities are feeling the pinch, the regional universities and two-year colleges have been taking on cuts that are affecting their ability to remain competitive. burgess said the smaller institutions fear losing the benefit of being cheaper, having smaller class sizes and offering lower student-to-faculty ratios.  “you get to a point where if there’s a lesser gap in tuition rates, why would a student go to a regional university instead of an ou or an osu?” burgess said.  with state appropriations on the decline, universities and colleges are seeking tuition and fee increases to compensate. the noc board, for example, approved a 5.5 percent tuition increase for the upcoming school year. likewise, the state regents for higher education approved a 5.3-percent increase in tuition for the entire higher education system last month.  cheryl evans, president, northern oklahoma college  “we understand the financial sacrifice many of our students and their families make in order to seek a higher education, and raising the cost of tuition is not a decision that the college takes lightly; however, this increase will assist in preserving the quality of the student experience at northern,” said noc president cheryl evans.  ‘further and further behind’  neuhold said the reduction in employees, purchases and travel is the reality of the budget cuts, but she agreed that students could potentially suffer the most.  “we are further and further behind — if enrollment held steady and tuition held steady, we would still be two to three million (dollars) behind every year,” neuhold said. “i think we are all feeling the pinch. we are burdening our students. the state has burdened our students with covering a crazy amount they didn’t have to cover before.”  ben hardcastle, vice president of university relations, said one of the other concerns at neosu was that the budget cuts might make the university a less appealing workplace for the faculty and staff.  “our staff is very resilient and dedicated, but our lower salaries are making it difficult for many talented professionals to afford to stay at a university they are so dedicated to,” said hardcastle.  conservative group in favor of more cuts  not everyone believes the higher education system has taken enough of a cut. the oklahoma council of public affairs has long advocated for making cuts to the higher education budget, including a proposal this year to eliminate at least 10 percent of non-essential staff at all public universities and colleges within the state. jonathan small, ocpa president, said the higher education system has routinely found a way to excessively spend money.  “when they get more money, they spend more money,” small said.  with oklahoma’s fortunes tied to a struggling oil and gas industry, the state has found itself with decreasing revenue for the past few years. the tax revenue available for state appropriations has been on the decline since fiscal year 2015. in addition to the state facing budget challenges, oklahoma families have felt pressure stemming from increased unemployment and fewer jobs. small said while families continue to struggle with keeping up with their bills, the higher education system continues to grow and expand as if the state were thriving in a surplus economy.  “the problem to a large degree is that the higher education structure hasn’t adapted to what is going on elsewhere,” small said. “higher ed seems to be moving in the opposite direction.”  small said one of the counter-trends involves former politicians being given non-essential jobs at state universities. he pointed to ou’s hiring of former state senators jonathan nichols as a $175,000-a-year lobbyist and jabar shumate as a $225,000-a-year diversity czar as examples of former elected officials finding new but lucrative careers within the higher education system. noting that higher education chancellor glen d. johnson – a former oklahoma speaker of the house – receives a higher salary than u.s. president donald trump, small said higher education was turning out to be a destination for retired politicians.  “the parachute for pols is higher ed in oklahoma,” small said. “i don’t think that can be overlooked.”  oklahoma higher ed’ ranks fifth in affordability  higher education officials insist they are doing all they can to keep up with the declining state appropriations while maintaining affordable tuition for those who enroll. the numbers seem to back them up when compared to their counterparts in other states. the u.s. chamber of commerce shows oklahoma’s system as the fifth-most affordable in the nation, while the national center for education statistics has oklahoma ranking third-lowest in terms of average cost at a four-year university.  support journalism     tags higher education ocpa osu ou board of regents state budget university of oklahoma   share   facebook  twitter       jeff packham

college savings plans of 2020 financial aid & debt the true cost of waiting to save for university of central oklahoma most families will aim to save less than 100% of their total projected college costs. your child may receive grants or scholarships towards college, and you may use loans or current income to pay a portion of the costs. the chart below illustrates the monthly contributions necessary to meet different targets, and how much they increase each year you wait to start saving. required monthly savings net cost: age 4 age 7 age 10 age 13 age 17 pay for 30% of college pay for 50% of college pay for 70% of college $1 $1 total debt after graduation this is the total amount your child will have to pay back after graduation. it includes the amount borrowed (principal), plus any loan fees and interest accrued while they are in school or during the grace period before repayment begins. $0 $0 / month monthly loan payment this is the amount your child will be expected to pay each month toward their loan balance. this tool assumes a 10-year repayment term and a 6% interest rate. generally, the monthly loan payment will be about 1% of the total debt at graduation. total student loan payments during life of loan this is the total amount your child will have to repay, including principal and interest. this tool assumes a 10-year repayment term and a 6% interest rate. in plain english when helping your child evaluate student loan options, be sure to consider both the monthly loan payment and the total payments. the monthly payments can be reduced by extending the loan term, but your child will end up paying more over time in interest. a smarter way to reduce your child's future monthly payments is to start saving money well before college. every dollar you save for your child will reduce the amount they will have to borrow and pay back with interest. how your college savings can reduce your child's future student loan debt student debt vs annual income after graduation $1 $38,400 the more you save for your child before college, the less they will have to pay back after college. a good rule of thumb is to keep total debt less than your child's expected annual income. that way they should be able to afford to repay their loans in 10 years or less. percent (%) of your child's monthly income that goes into paying back student loan debt monthly salary: $3,200 0% you'll also want to compare your child's monthly payments to their monthly income. anything less than 10% is considered affordable, 15% is a stretch, and anything over 20% is not recommended. in plain english this analysis is based on projections of college savings and college costs. it demonstrates the impact of savings on debt after graduation. the more you save, the less you'll have to borrow. this tool can help you determine how much you need to save to ensure that your child graduates with an affordable amount of debt at each college or university. this tool assumes that a college's net price will continue to increase at the same rate as recent increases. it also assumes that the earnings in a college savings plan will reflect historical averages. since past
